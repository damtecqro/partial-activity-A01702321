What made it easier for you to implement the view? 
The ability to see what the view would look like and also having the base that
was developed in class.

What made it difficult for you to implement the view?
First of all, my computer is very slow and it gets stuck a lot of the time making its very difficult
to use android studio and not letting me use an emulator in my computer.

I have a lot of trouble understanding most parts and what everything does in android studio. I needed
a lot of help from classmates and the internet. I also have a lot of trouble understanding how JSON works
but I want to at least understand kotlin.
